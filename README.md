- Day 15 of being unable to code much

Final-year Bsc Information Technology student and junior software developer who turns ideas into reliable software. Programming feels like beating a video game boss—you fail, level up, and eventually succeed (unless it's Dark Souls). Most projects are open-source, but please check my [terms of service](https://tinotenda-mhedziso.pages.dev/#tos) and pay Attribution to third-party owners where respective assets are used.


>[!Tip]
> If you like any project that you see, **please star 🌟 it and follow me**. Helps a small junior dev trying to make it.
