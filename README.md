Hey There... Yes, You right there 🔎
Thanks for taking the time to view my project showcase. I am a Final year Bachelor of Information Technology student and junior software developer who turns ideas into innovative software that usually doesn't normally break. Whether I am refining my JavaScript skills or learning more about C#, I view programming as the process of defeating a video game boss: after failing indefinitely, you eventually level up and succeed... unless it's dark souls then **ye**. I have crafted all sorts of things | A mobile app prototype | Node based Chatbot | Some websites | so feel free to look around (P.S I even know how to centre a div). Most software displayed here is open-source, meaning you can basically do whatever you want but since some projects I have acquired assets through other third parties, please view my [terms of service](https://tinotenda-mhedziso.pages.dev/#tos) before modifying or distrubuting any entity owned by me.
>[!Tip]
> If you like any project that you see, **please star 🌟 it and follow me**. Helps a small junior dev trying to make it.
