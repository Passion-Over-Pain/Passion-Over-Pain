Hello there! 👋 I'm a passionate developer and creative thinker dedicated to crafting engaging digital experiences. Here's a snapshot of my journey, my current projects, and what drives my work.

## 🛠️ **Current Focus**
>[!NOTE]
> ...I am Constantly Revising it so no set structure yet...
- 🚀 **Building an RPG Game**  
  A vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript desktop game with rich storytelling, complex branching paths, and fast-paced mini-games.  The game is currently not released that's why you won't find it here :). Follow Me to keep updated though. <br>
  🎮 Key Features:  
  - **Dynamic character creation**  
  - **Modular visual interfaces**  
  - **Smooth animations powered by IntersectionObserver API**

- 📖 **World-building**  
  🌍 Expanding kingdoms, characters, and lore for immersive RPG gameplay.  
  ✨ **Featured Characters:**  
  - **Atlas Six**: A party of heroes, each with unique backstories and branching interactions.
Trying to produce an experience that is both fun and induces creativity.
